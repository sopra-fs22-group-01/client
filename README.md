# Cards Against Humanity Online
This project contains everything you need to play a fun game of Cards Against Humanity online with your friends. Enjoy our twist to the game and try out the additional features such as custom cards, and supervotes. 
## Introduction
### Main Goal
This project's main goal is to enable players to play Cards Against Humanity online. Compared to the original Cards Against Humanity game, we also changed some of the original mechanics and added some additional fun features. By doing so we learned a lot about developing a web application and how to work efficiently in a group of 5.

### Motivation
Our general motivation for this project was to expand our knowledge about software development with experience and practice. We choose to create a card game which we all consider fun to play to help us stay motivated and keep morals up.

## Technologies
The technologies used to develop the server side of this project were the following:

-   WebStorm, IntelliJ and Visual Studio Code as IDEs
-   GitHub for the version control and project organization
-   Heroku for the deployment
-   Node.js as JavaScript runtime environment

## Main Components
In our frontend code, we have five main components that are crucial for the game. They are all contained in our [Main](/src/) folder. 
1.  The most important views:
    -  The [Welcome view](src/components/views/StartPage.js) that greets the users and leads them to the login/registration views respectively
    -  The [Login view](src/components/views/Login.js) responsible for letting to users log into their account, and a very similar [Registration view](src/components/views/Registration.js) for the registration of new users.
    -  The [Profile view](src/components/views/ProfilePage.js), providing the user to navigate to the [edit Profile view](src/components/views/EditProfile.js), to the [Statistics view](src/components/views/Statistics.js) of the profile, to the [Lobbies overview](src/components/views/JoinLobby.js) and also provides the possibility to log out and return to the [Login view](src/components/views/Login.js)
    -  The [Lobbies overview](src/components/views/JoinLobby.js) that lets the user create new lobbies are join already present lobbies. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91260375/170558623-d770e333-95d2-4a32-8fbc-0328b105bd89.png" width=650>
    -  The [Lobby view](src/components/views/Lobby.js), where the users can see the other players and create their own custom card for the game. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91260375/170559234-79c40f85-0327-4550-9421-6e91d8dc5be6.png" width=650>
    -  The [Card selection view](src/components/views/Round.js), where the players select the cards they want to play. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91260375/170560319-b821abb6-12ef-4a47-ad64-aae0e037eae1.png" width=650>
    -  The [Voting view](src/components/views/Voting.js), where the players can vote for the best played card. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91260375/170560372-dc776860-016b-4278-bb44-20de836b0de6.png" width=650>
    -  The [Round winner view](src/components/views/Winner.js), where the winner(s) of the round is anounced and the winnig card combination is read to everyone. <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91260375/170560441-ee93f5cf-6804-4ae5-9dfe-02ae05eb826e.png" width=650>

## Getting started

Read and go through these Tutorials. It will make your life easier!

- Read the React [Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- Do this React [Getting Started](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) Tutorial (it doesnâ€™t assume any existing React knowledge)
- Get an Understanding of [CSS](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/), [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/syntax), and [HTML](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp)!

Next, there are two other technologies that you should look at:

* [react-router-dom](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start) offers declarative routing for React. It is a collection of navigational components that fit nicely with the application. 
* [react-hooks](https://reactrouter.com/web/api/Hooks) let you access the router's state and perform navigation from inside your components.

## Prerequisites and Installation
For your local development environment, you will need Node.js. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org). All other dependencies, including React, get installed with:

```npm install```

Run this command before you start your application for the first time. Next, you can start the app with:

```npm run dev```

Now you can open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

Notice that the page will reload if you make any edits. You will also see any lint errors in the console (use Google Chrome).

### Testing
Testing is optional, and you can run the tests with `npm run test`.
This launches the test runner in an interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

> For macOS user running into a 'fsevents' error: https://github.com/jest-community/vscode-jest/issues/423

### Build
Finally, `npm run build` builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance: the build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.<br>

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
